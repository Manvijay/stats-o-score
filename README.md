MVP:
Our goal is to make an Android App by the name "Stat-o-Score" that will provide a new vision to the sports app category. Usually sports app tick few important boxes, like provide stats for players or provide scores of matches. However, we plan on adding some twist to that and add a sort of minigame in the app, which will be a kind of battle arena where the user can compare two players and see which one comes to the top. We also want to have a leaderboard where we show the most searched/compared players .Our app will currently only focus on one sport i.e. "cricket" (because we are very passionate about the game!!).  

The following are the main goals of our app that we plan on completing before the end of CSE442 semester :-
1> Add live score of ongoing matches
2> Add schedule of future matches for the year
3> Add stats of all the international players in the world right now
4> Add a VS battle mode and a leaderboard for the players (minigame).

ADD-ON Features:
Though we have a vivid version of the app there are certain features we believe that we wouldn't be able to include right because of time constraints and inexperience. Also there are certain features in this list which would also require a considerable about of funding :-

-> Cover more sports than cricket, like football, soccer, tennis and leagues like NBA, NFL etc
-> Create a newsfeed where the user can search by player name and read all the current news about the player. This would fetch news data about the player from the internet and show all the news stories about the player in question
-> To elaborate on our mingame and create a fantasy league, where users can make their teams and gain points depending on how the player performes in real life.
-> Live streaming of live matches in the app itself. We could partner with live streaming apps like SlingTV to fulfill this requirement  


USER STORY:

On starting the app, I see the loading screen which has the app logo. The loading screen is followed by 4 buttons namely Live Score, Future Schedule, Stats and Battle.There is a gear button on the bottom left corner of the page which opens the settings page. On tapping the Live Score button, the live score page opens which has the score of the ongoing match. This page also has the hamburger menu button on the top left corner of the page. On tapping the Hamburger button, the side menu bar opens which contains all the tabs. The future schedule page shows all the major teams on the page. On tapping any team, a new page opens displaying the upcoming matches of that team. The Stats Page has a search bar. On searching a particular player , a new page shows the stats of the players such as number of matches played, score, 100s , 50s , etc. On selecting the Battle tab, a new page opens with 2 search tabs. On selecting both players, there is a side by side comparison of both players and there is a stats battle on basis of score and average of the player. Each page has a back button on the bottom left. The physical back button of the phone works as the back button as well.
