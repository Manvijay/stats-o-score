## **IMPORTANT NOTICE TO DEVS !!!**
We know that when you run app in Android Studio you might see a lot of errors in the IDE.
This has to do with some android studio update error because on older versions it didn't show us any. We are currently looking into a workaround to temporarily stop showing those errors.
Regardless the app will run fine on your phone as well as android studio

## **Overview:-**
Our goal is to make an Android App by the name "Stats-o-Score" that will provide a new vision to the sports app category. Usually sports app tick few important boxes, like providing stats for players or provide scores of matches. However, we plan on adding a new dimesnion  to that and add a sort of minigame within the app, which will be a kind of battle arena. Here, the user can compare two players and see which one comes on top. Initially this app will focus on one soccer and we plan on adding more sports later.  

## **MVP:-**
**The following are the main goals of our app that we plan on completing before the end of CSE442 semester :-**
1. Add live score of ongoing matches
2. Add schedule of future matches for the year
3. Add stats of all the international players in the world right now
4. Add a VS battle mode and a leaderboard for the players (minigame).

## **ADD-ON Features:**
Though we have a vivid version of the app there are certain features we believe that we wouldn't be able to include right because of time constraints and inexperience. Also there are certain features in this list which would also require a considerable about of funding :-

- Cover more sports than cricket, tennis and leagues like NBA, NFL etc
- Create a newsfeed where the user can search by player name and read all the current news about the player. This would fetch news data about the player from the internet and show all the news stories about the player in question
- To elaborate on our mingame and create a fantasy league, where users can make their teams and gain points depending on how the player performes in real life.
- Live streaming of live matches in the app itself. We could partner with live streaming apps or providers to fulfill this requirement  

## **USER STORY:**

I want an app on my smartphone that gives me live scores of soccer games going on right now. I want to see the standings of my favourite soccer club playing in a league. I should be able to compare two proffessional soccer players currently playing and see which of the two is better based on his stats like strength, free kick prowess, sprint speed and many more.
