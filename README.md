MVP:
Our goal is to make an Android App by the name "Stat-o-Score" that will provide a new vision to the sports app category. Usually sports app tick few important boxes, like provide stats for players or provide scores of matches. However, we plan on adding some twist to that and add a sort of minigame in the app, which will be a kind of battle arena where the user can compare two players and see which one comes to the top. Our app will currently only focus on one sport i.e. "soccer" (because we are very passionate about the game!!).  

The following are the main goals of our app that we plan on completing before the end of CSE442 semester :-
1> Add live score of ongoing matches
2> Add schedule of future matches for the year
3> Add stats of all the international players in the world right now
4> Add a VS battle mode and a leaderboard for the players (minigame).

ADD-ON Features:
Though we have a vivid version of the app there are certain features we believe that we wouldn't be able to include right because of time constraints and inexperience. Also there are certain features in this list which would also require a considerable about of funding :-

-> Cover more sports than cricket, like football, tennis and leagues like NBA, NFL etc
-> Create a newsfeed where the user can search by player name and read all the current news about the player. This would fetch news data about the player from the internet and show all the news stories about the player in question
-> To elaborate on our mingame and create a fantasy league, where users can make their teams and gain points depending on how the player performes in real life.
-> Live streaming of live matches in the app itself. We could partner with live streaming apps or providers to fulfill this requirement  

USER STORY:

I want an app on my smartphone that gives me live scores of soccer games going on right now. I also want to see the standings of my favourite soccer club in playing in a league. I also want to use the app to be able to compare two proffessional soccer players currently playing an see which of two is better based on his stats like strength, free kick prowess, sprint speed and many more.
